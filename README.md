# C++ Practice Tasks

## Task 1: Working with Different Data Types

### Objective:
Understand how different data types work and how to store values in them using the assignment operator.

### Description:
1. Declare the following variables:
   - An `int` for storing an integer.
   - A `float` for storing a decimal number.
   - A `char` for storing a single character.
   - A `bool` for storing a boolean value.

2. Assign values to these variables and print them using `cout`.

### Steps and Hints:
- Declare variables such as `int num`, `float decimal`, `char letter`, and `bool isTrue`.
- Assign values and use `cout` to display them.

## Task 2: Taking Input from the User

### Objective:
Practice taking input from the user using `cin`.

### Description:
1. Take input for an integer, a float, and a character from the user and print them back.

### Steps and Hints:
- Use `cin` to gather input for the declared variables.
- Print the values entered by the user with `cout`.

---

## Task 3: Using Assignment Operators

### Objective:
Understand how to use the basic assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).

### Description:
1. Perform arithmetic operations using assignment operators on an integer variable.

### Steps and Hints:
- Start with an integer variable and modify its value using different assignment operators.
- Print the final result to see the changes.

---

## Task 4: Logical Operators with Boolean Values

### Objective:
Learn to use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) with boolean variables.

### Description:
1. Write a program that checks two boolean variables and prints the result of logical operations.

### Steps and Hints:
- Declare two boolean variables (`isHot` and `isSunny`).
- Use logical operators and print the results using `cout`.

---

## Task 5: Comparison Operators with User Input

### Objective:
Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to compare user input.

### Description:
1. Ask the user to input two numbers (integers or floats).
2. Compare the two numbers using comparison operators and print the results.

### Steps and Hints:
- Declare two integer variables (`a` and `b`), take user input, and apply comparison operators.
- Print the comparison results with `cout`.

---

## Task 6: Using Ternary Operator

### Objective:
Use the ternary operator to make simple decisions.

### Description:
1. Take a number as input from the user and check if it is even or odd using the ternary operator.

### Steps and Hints:
- Use the ternary operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- Print whether the number is even or odd.

---

## Task 7: Calculating the Area of a Garden

### Objective:
Understand how to calculate the area of a rectangle.

### Description:
1. The length of a rectangular garden is 10 meters, and the width is 5 meters. Find the area using the formula `Area = Length * Width`.

### Hint:
- Area calculation is simple multiplication of the two values (Length and Width).
